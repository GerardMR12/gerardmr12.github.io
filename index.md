My name is Gerard Morales Riera. I graduated in Aerospace Technology Engineering and Engineering Physics from [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/ca). I pursued this dual degree as part of the [CFIS-UPC](https://cfis.upc.edu/es/el-centro/que-es-el-cfis) program, which focuses on joint STEM degrees.

This dual degree was performed during the fixed amount of 4.5 years, where I got honours in subjects like Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods or Engineering Projects. At the end of this period, I completed my degree thesis at Prof. Daniel Selva's [research group](https://www.selva-research.com/), where conducted studies on AI-driven satellites.

# Degree thesis

My thesis with Dr. Selva at Texas A&M, called [Earth Observation Satellite Planning Problem with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Transformers](/assets/files/Degree-Thesis-GerardMR.pdf), focused on developing advanced algorithms for optimizing satellite maneuvering using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

With the **Soft Actor-Critic** (SAC) and **Proximal Policy Optimization** (PPO) algorithms, I tackled the complex planning problem. In it, the satellite should learn how to move around a simulated Earth and observe as many points of interest as possible while optimizing its energy consumption.

In the previous .gif, one can see how the agent is looking at Earth all the time and always trying to hover over points of interest.

In addition, I focused on the comprehension of **transformer-based architectures**, given their adequacy to handle sequential data and long-range dependencies. These sort of models clearly outperformed traditional neural nets in my case of study.

The results demonstrated the potential of using advanced reinforcement learning techniques for real-world satellite operations, paving the way for more efficient, intelligent and reactive Earth observation constellations.

Coding was in Python, with self-made [environment](https://github.com/GerardMR12/earth-gym.git) and Ansys STK12 (Texas A&M license) as orbit propagator. For ML tasks, PyTorch was [used](https://github.com/GerardMR12/ppo-eos.git).

# UPC ecoRacing

As a member of the [UPC ecoRacing](https://www.ecoracing.es/) Formula Student team, I contributed to the development of a high-performance electric race car. My main focus was on the design and implementation of the vehicle's aerodynamics, which are crucial for optimizing performance on the track.

My colleagues and I worked closely together to analyze and improve the car's aerodynamic properties using computer-aided design (CAD), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) manufacturing and aerodynamic validation testing.

The car of the image counts on very advanced full-package aerodynamics, including a recently made front wing with increased wake management and a triple-element rear wing with drag reduction system (DRS). Also, it can drive autonomously with the driverless system (DV).

We had a great experience participating in summer competitions like Formula Student Netherlands, Germany, East (Hungary) and Spain.
